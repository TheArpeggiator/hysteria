# hysteria

Use of the openFrameworks tool to create an audio visual experience

Description
-----------

Have computers taking to each other (basically). 
Each computer will have an assigned voice. i.e. set freq range. Since range is set, they know what to 'listen' for.
Each computer is named as a 'heretic'. When a heretic speaks, last note played belongs to one of the the voices. That trigger the other heretic to respond.

Sometimes the last note will be missed, this cause both heretics to speak together. (there will be pauses after last note played, so if trigger note is not recognised i.e. not from listening heretic's 'voice', the heretic responds and the original heretic continues to speak. 

This is a state of 'hysteria'. Here, both heretics switch to a 'surreal' freq range which is a fancy way of saying that they move to a common range. Gain increases rapidly and when it reaches a threshold, the system resets.
